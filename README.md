#Hello World
This is a readme.

This is Jackson White and github is cool!

Github is software that interacts with git, which is way of organizing contributions from multiple people on a single project.
Github facilitates version control for files that are updated and modified, and allows people to create separate branches
to test out new features or modifications to the code without changing the code for everyone. It also helps people merge their
separate work on the same project so that when multiple people work on one section of code, it doesn't become a jumbled mess as 
easily.
